#### transfer

Transfers `_amount` of tokens to the `_recipient` address.
The function triggers a `Transfer` event and reverts if the senderâ€™s balance is insufficient.

It is worth mentioning that transfers with a value of 0 must still trigger the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool success)
```
