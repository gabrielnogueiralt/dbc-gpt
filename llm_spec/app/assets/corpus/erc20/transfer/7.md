#### transfer

* Moves _value tokens to target.
* Must revert if the senderâ€™s balance is lower than the specified amount.

Observations:
* Transfers of 0 tokens should trigger the `Transfer` event as usual.

``` js
function transfer(address ____target, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
