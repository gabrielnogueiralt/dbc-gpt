#### transfer


This function sends `val` tokens to the address `t` and must trigger the `Transfer` event.
It will fail (`throw`) if the sender's account doesnâ€™t have enough tokens.

Note: Sending 0 tokens is allowed and will still trigger the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address t, uint256 val) public returns (bool s)
```
