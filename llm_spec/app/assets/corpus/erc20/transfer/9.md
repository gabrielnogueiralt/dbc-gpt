#### transfer

Moves `_value` tokens from the sender's account to the `_to` address, and MUST trigger the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD revert if the sender doesn't have enough tokens.

*Note* Transfers of 0 tokens MUST be treated as valid transfers and MUST trigger the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
