#### transfer

The function reverts if the caller lacks sufficient tokens.
Sends `_tokens` from the callerâ€™s account to `receiver` and must emit the `Transfer` event.
Transfers of no tokens should be treated normally and also emit the `Transfer` event.


``` js
function transfer(address receiver, uint256 _tokens) public returns (bool success)
```
