#### transfer

Sends `_value` tokens from the caller's account to the `_to` address, and MUST emit the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD fail if the message sender's account balance has insufficient tokens.

*Note* Even zero-value transfers MUST be considered valid and MUST emit the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
