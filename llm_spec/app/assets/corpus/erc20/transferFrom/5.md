#### transferFrom

Transfers `_valueAmount` from the `_spender` address to `_beneficiary`, typically for payments or withdrawals. This function should emit a `Transfer` event, even if the transferred value is zero.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _spender, address _beneficiary, uint256 _valueAmount) public returns (bool s)
```
