#### approve

Permits `_spender` to withdraw from the caller's account up to the `_value` amount. Subsequent invocations replace the current allowance.

**NOTE**: For protection against certain attack scenarios, users should consider setting the allowance to zero before modifying it, although this isn't required at the contract level for compatibility reasons.

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
