#### approve

Enables `_spender` to transfer a maximum of `_value` tokens from the function caller's balance. This function will overwrite any existing allowance when called again for the same spender.

**NOTE**: To avoid potential security vulnerabilities, it's recommended that clients implement a two-step process where they first reduce allowance to zero before increasing it. The contract itself doesn't enforce this behavior to maintain backward compatibility.

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
