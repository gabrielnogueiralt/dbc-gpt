#### approve

Updates the amount of tokens that `_spender` is authorized to transfer from the caller's account. The new approval amount will replace any previously set value.

**NOTE**: To protect against potential front-running attacks, it's advisable for user interfaces to implement a flow that first sets the allowance to zero before setting a new value for the same spender. The contract doesn't impose this requirement to ensure compatibility with existing contracts.

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
