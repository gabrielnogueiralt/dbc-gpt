#### approve

Authorizes `_spender` to transfer tokens from the sender's account, up to the specified `_value`. This overwrites any previous approval for the same spender.

**NOTE**: For security reasons, it's advised to set the allowance to zero first before changing it to a new value for the same spender. However, the contract doesn't enforce this to maintain compatibility with earlier deployments.

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
