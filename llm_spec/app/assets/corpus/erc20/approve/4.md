#### approve

Grants permission to `_spender` to transfer up to `_value` tokens from the caller's account. If this function is called again, it replaces the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To mitigate potential attack vectors, it's recommended for interfaces to first set the allowance to 0 before setting it to a new value for the same spender, though this isn't enforced at the contract level for backward compatibility.

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
