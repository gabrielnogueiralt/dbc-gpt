#### approve

Sets the spending allowance for `_spender` to withdraw from your account, limited to `_value` tokens. Any subsequent calls will override the previous allowance.

**NOTE**: Due to security concerns related to potential race conditions, user interfaces should be designed to reset allowances to zero before setting a new non-zero value for the same spender. The contract itself doesn't enforce this pattern to remain compatible with existing deployments.

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
