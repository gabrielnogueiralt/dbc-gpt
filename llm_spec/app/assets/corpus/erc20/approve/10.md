#### approve

Establishes or modifies the number of tokens that the `_spender` address can withdraw from the sender's account, up to the specified `_value`. Any existing allowance will be completely replaced.

**NOTE**: For enhanced security, implementations should consider requiring users to first reduce the spender's allowance to zero before increasing it to mitigate race condition vulnerabilities. This isn't enforced by the contract itself for backward compatibility reasons.

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
